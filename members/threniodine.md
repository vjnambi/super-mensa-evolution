As a support main, Threniodine's favorite champs are Braum and Morgana for their defensive prowess. However, Threniodine mostly plays Nautilus because of the agency that his offensive power gives. Threniodine has also recently branched out into the jungle role, playing primarily Nunu and Hecarim. Threniodine also manages the Super Mensa Evolution website.
