As a top laner and Garen aficionado, LaRosa popularized the idea that simple champs are better. The reasoning is that less time is spent learning the champ's mechanics and more time is spent learning League's fundamentals. LaRosa favors Garen, Cho'Gath, and Volibear and draws most bans in clash tournaments. Recently, he has been learning and finding success on the new smite Janna top lane strategy.
